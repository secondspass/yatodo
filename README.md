A To Do app in Flutter. Because we totally needed another one. It's not on Play Store or
the App Store so don't worry about it.

## Installation

1. You'll need the Flutter tools installed first. Check the [documentation](https://flutter.io/).
2. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.
3. Plug in your phone via USB to your computer. Make sure USB debugging is on.
4. Run `flutter build apk` to create an Android apk (`flutter build ios` if you're on a
   Mac and you want an iPhone app).
5. Run `flutter install` to install the app on to your phone.

## Using the app
1. Touch the '+' button to add new items to the list.
2. Enter the item name and touch the `add item` button to add it to the list.
3. Long press an item to delete it.
4. Touch the 'delete sweep' icon at the top right to clear the list.
